# NOTICE

Please note that this branch has been tombstoned. The original repo flow with separate branches
for main and extended functionality became too complicated to maintain even for me, who invented it :smile:.

The part of extended completions from this branch has been moved to `master`. Others was considered
stale and non-maintained, so they were deleted. If at one moment whoever will decide to resurrect
them, he'll be able to do this from branch history.
